# Backend for All Dogs Project

- This is the backend for my All Dogs project. The backend is built using JSON Server, a simple tool that allows you to set up a full fake REST API with zero effort.

## Deployment

- I used [this document](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/deploy-json-server-on-render-for-free-stepbystep-guide-814141) to deploy my db.json file on Render. Here's a quick summary of the steps I followed:

1.  Set up json-server dependency: In the package.json file, I made sure the json-server dependency is set as follows:

        `"dependencies": {
        "json-server": "^0.17.0"
        }`

2.  Run npm install: After ensuring the correct dependency version, I ran `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.

3.  Configure index.js: I added the following code block to my `index.js` file to configure and set up the server with json-server:

    ```const jsonServer = require("json-server"); // importing json-server library
    const server = jsonServer.create();
    const router = jsonServer.router("db.json");
    const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3001; // you can use any port number here; I chose to use 3001

    server.use(middlewares);
    server.use(router);
    server.listen(port);
    ```

4.  Followed deployment guide: I continued with the deployment process as described in the guide above to deploy the backend on Render.
